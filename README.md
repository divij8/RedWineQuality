# Red Wine Quality
This involved basic Linear Regression to predict the quality of red wine based on certain data inputs.
The wine was scored on a scale of 10, and a good quality wine was a wine with a score higher than the 75%ile, in this case, 6.
I used the Linear Regression model to fit the model here.
